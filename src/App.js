                    <p>Hi, welcome to The Fashion Lounge!<br/>

Established in 2009, TFL is owned by two, DD & DV, who share a love for fashion. With over a decade of experience in the industry, our concept has evolved but our focus remains the same: to help make women feel beautiful & confident by expressing their unique sense of style!

As buyers for the store, we have two very different styles which is reflected in the casual/contemporary apparel & accessories found throughout our four different locations- thereâ€™s a little bit of something for everyone to appreciate!
